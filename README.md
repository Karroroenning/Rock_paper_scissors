# Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock

Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock is a Rock Paper Scissors v2.0. Maybe you have seen it on the tvshow ["Big Bang Theory"](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0898266/) sometime. 
You might have a dream to play it someday, but not many people know that version. So you've gotten a little tired of the usual one. No worries, here you can play it all night long against the computer. Which randomly selects one of the five options. 
If you win or lose, it says next to the result why you lose or win. So it's always clear and concise.

## Features

### **Existing Features**

## Landing page

**Header:**
The first impression is the most important. We have a large and clear header that is centered across the page. The feeling should be a bit like space and being in an arcade.

- I chose to have the dark background and a light header because the contrast is very good. The use of the neon sign feeling will take you back to the arcades you used to be in. You see in the pictures i inserted here. That the sign is glitching. It gives you more of an arcade feel.

**Start Game:**
When you hover over the "start game" sign, there is a very subtle zoom that shows it is a clickable link. That takes you to the game page.

- Considering that the header takes up a lot of focus on the page, I chose to have the start game a little more discreet so that it doesn't get too messy. There must not be too much happening on the page so that the user gets confused.

**Hover:**

## Game page

Here we have the core of the web page. The first thing to look at is the game board. Which is slightly larger than the rest of the pictures on the page. The focus must always be there. A little further down we have the user's game options. There, the user has 5 options to choose from. But choose wisely the computer is smart. But not smarter than you. 

**Header:**

The header text is the name of the game. On this page, this text should not be the first thing the user looks at. It should still be the game board. It is discreet and the size is smaller. But when you press it, you get to the first page again.

**Restart game:**

The restart game button is a function that should not have too much focus, but it is an important function. If you start to feel sad that you win all the time or want to hand the game over to someone else, you can simply press restart game and the page will be reset.

- Here I want the button to be contiguous with the button on the first page. Same font-family and same hover. So the user understands that it is a button that can be pressed.

**Gameboard:**

On the game board we have the game itself. The computer's side on what it chooses and the user's side what the user chooses for options to play with. Depending on who wins, it will get a point.

- I chose to make the playing field a little bigger so that the focus remains on the playing field.
I have taken the images from google, but I have redone them in photoshop so that it is more consistent with the game.

**Result:**

I find this quite interesting. When the game is started and someone wins or loses, it says if you win or lose but also for those who haven't played this before, there will always be a short explanation of what the options do to each other to win.

- I think the experience is better when you get an explanation of why you win or lose. So you never feel that it is unfair. This game must be fair. A small detail that provides a very funny piece of information

**User choices:**

Five game options that the user can choose from before each game round. But when you push, there is no going back. When you press an option, the game starts.

- I chose to have five options to make it more exciting. Many have played rock paper scissors, but here two options have been added. The images have the same colors and could then be mixed together. That's why I've put a different color around so that you can tell them apart. I have the neon color to once again get the feeling of an arcade.

**Accessibility**

## Bugs

- I was reminded by the lighthouse in devtools that I forgot the "alt" alternative in the pictures. So I had to google how to get the "alt" option in javascript. Because it was something I hadn't done before. I read a lot, but no code that I found worked. So I had to think logically and try to solve it myself. And it worked out.

- I had put all the pictures outside of a folder because I didn't know how to get the pictures in from a folder. When I spoke to my mentor (Martina) she said it would not be approved. So she sent me three similar projects so I could compare and see how they did with their images. I managed to do a little but I had help from tutor support for the final touch. I had forgotten the console.log.
