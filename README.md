# Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock

Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock is a Rock Paper Scissors v2.0. Maybe you have seen it on the tvshow ["Big Bang Theory"](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0898266/) sometime. 
You might have a dream to play it someday, but not many people know that version. So you've gotten a little tired of the usual one. No worries, here you can play it all night long against the computer. Which randomly selects one of the five options. 
If you win or lose, it says next to the result why you lose or win. So it's always clear and concise.

## Landing page

**Header:**
The first impression is the most important. We have a large and clear header that is centered across the page. The feeling should be a bit like space and being in an arcade.

- I chose to have the dark background and a light header because the contrast is very good. The use of the neon sign feeling will take you back to the arcades you used to be in. When you hover over the start game sign, there is a very subtle zoom that shows it is a clickable link. That takes you to the game page.
