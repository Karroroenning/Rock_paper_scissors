# Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock

Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock is a Rock Paper Scissors v2.0. Maybe you have seen it on the tvshow ["Big Bang Theory"](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0898266/) sometime. 
You might have a dream to play it someday, but not many people know that version. So you've gotten a little tired of the usual one. No worries, here you can play it all night long against the computer. Which randomly selects one of the five options. 
If you win or lose, it says next to the result why you lose or win. So it's always clear and concise.

## Landing page

**Header:**
The first impression is the most important. We have a large and clear header that is centered across the page. The feeling should be a bit like space and being in an arcade.

- I chose to have the dark background and a light header because the contrast is very good. The use of the neon sign feeling will take you back to the arcades you used to be in. You see in the pictures i inserted here. That the sign is glitching. It gives you more of an arcade feel.

**Start Game:**
When you hover over the "start game" sign, there is a very subtle zoom that shows it is a clickable link. That takes you to the game page.

- Considering that the header takes up a lot of focus on the page, I chose to have the start game a little more discreet so that it doesn't get too messy. There must not be too much happening on the page so that the user gets confused
